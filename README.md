# gradient-descent-and-logistic-regression

## Overview

This project implements gradient descent optimization and logistic regression with regularization. It includes:

- Gradient descent with customizable learning rate strategies.
- Regularized logistic regression supporting L1 and L2 penalties.
- Visualizations of optimization behavior and model performance.
